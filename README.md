# The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors Page Project

## Description

This is the third project of the **Foundations Course** of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It is intended to put in practice the knowledge acquired on **Basic JavaScript** and **DOM Manipulation**. The result is a webpage on which you can play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer using a simple user interface

> **Rock Paper Scissors** is hand game where two players choose simultaneously between three different shapes that imitate a rock, a paper foil, and scissors. The winner is determined according to these rules:
>
> 1. Rock breaks Scissors, but loses against Paper
>
> 2. Scissors cuts Paper, but loses against Rock
>
> 3. Paper covers Rock, but loses against Scissors
>
> Only three outputs are possible: win, lose, or draw if both players choose the same shape. Since the game requires the players to take a decision at the same time without knowing what the opponent will choose, it is often used as a fair choosing method.

- The webpage has two almost identical sections, where the score and the choice of each player is shown

- The section where the information of the user is shown has three buttons where they can choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer section however only has a label instead of buttons

- To play a round, the user needs to click in any of the buttons. This automatically makes the computer to choose

- Depending on the result of the round, the scores are updated and the website shows you a text indicating if you won, lost, or it was a draw round. The round count also updates each time a round is played

- The game ends when any of the players reaches a score of 5 points. The visual design of the website changes to let the player know the game has ended and the buttons that let the user play a round are temporarily disabled

- A new button at the bottom of the page appears when the game has ended, so the user can click it to play a new game. Once the user clicks it, the webpage is reset to its original state, and the user can start all over again

## What did I learn?

- How create functions, and divide a problem in modules to solve it

- How to use manipulate elements in the DOM of the website

- How to handle events with event listeners and callback functions

- How to integrate JavaScript into a website to make it interactive
